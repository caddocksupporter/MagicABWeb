the brigade will heading north west to <font color="green">Sri Lanka<font color="white">,where a mission called"mixture of jungle and coast"being carry out. The very first real challenge will happen at <font color="light_blue">arabian sea<font color="white">, abyssal capable to coop with pirate in <font color="green">Yemen and Somalia.<font color="white"><br>

<font color="grey"><font size="6">【GAMEPLAY DETAIL】<p>
<font color="white"><font size="4">From local sea area or waters, to stormy seas or complicated terrain where extra caution should the player take,<br>
the game will project the enviroment by illustrating the background, there will be a silhouette of an oilrig if the battle area was offshore oilrig distrct; if the area was city nearby, such as Shanghai in level 96, a glittering city night view shall be shown on screen.<br>
The creator really love different type of scenery can be screen on a interactive media, whatever kind of method it uses, it`s going to be facinating in his opinion.<br>
The controlled area of player and hostile will change per 1 to 2 mission, while this game has 3 ending, so every win or loses will make things different,such as hostile force proceeding speed, the difficulty and length of battle,<br>
You might also receive more variety of attack, including inland artillery, navy forces, air raid or even Space laser weaponary.

<font color="grey"><font size="6">【NATURE OF GAME】<p>
<src="trobinterface.png">
<font color="white"><font size="4">As the image has shown, Kancolle:The Restoration Of Blue is a spin-off creation from shadez 2,3 by SeanTcooper. Everyone who have been exposed to it could realize the image is pretty much a clone of the former.<br>
Whom know about this have the right to critized the idea, nonetheless, considering it stands as a proposal destined to re-sculpt the unique brand owned by Tanaka, the suggester hope realizing it can help any players involved in the webgame which contains appalling service can take an other look at the game itself.<hr>
<font color="grey"><font size="6">【DETAIL ABOUT THE IDEA】<p>
<font color="white"><font size="4">The reason that creator desired to make this was...<p>
<font size="6"><font color="orange">"The existance of Kancolle Arcade is, in fact, a improved version of the original webgame. People who played it are able to experience more controllable gameplay, they can decide whether the enemy wll hit `em. If their fleet were slow if a torpedo is coming, the opportunity of taking its explosion is increased cause you just stand still and let them attack you; the opportunity will decrease if your speed is high. That said, it`s not luck controlls whether a torpedo or a bombshell hit you, but your own hand and mind. That`s first. Second was the player are now have the chance to interact with their character they like, the game, due to its 3D game nature, it has more 3D character animation, making player could see more about the one they loved and let those kanmusu more energetic and spontaneous.<br><p>
Nonetheless, in my mind,that does not mean the arcade game was enough to be call a"great game", are there couple reasons. One is that the game is pretty much dramatic depicted. Such as Yukikaze turn her body around and lowered to fire her torpedo. Actually, they should be horizontally fired into seawater, but developer did not make her body 90 degree angle due they want  to avoid her under to be seen, throwing away the correct usage just for adorable movement, pity I can`t see a point there. These developer went further on this with deep sea mine animation, every motion of ship girls toss their explosives are different. Ushio releasing her bomb from her machine with her body wiggling side to side(seen from figure2); Murasame instead sprinkle them like salt or flower pettle(seen from figure3),thought that was cute, but abosolutely not the right way, thats another place I am not satisfied with.<p>
<img src="mainpage2.png" alt="Figure2" width="1024" height="576"><p>
<img src="mainpage3.png" width="1024" height="576" alt="Figure3"><br>
So much for the animation part, as we all could see, all armory are maintain antique, even platform had changed. I understand everyone that experienced the webgame would no doubt love to see something familiar in it, there is nothing wrong to doubt the effectiveness of those weaponry against abyssal fleet with those techology in last-century-it should not do much damage to them if those creature are turn up in recent years. For that, should we realize those machine gun or torpedo from propeller plane has been outdated(many illustrator agree this point by making their very own technology gadget in thier fan-made creation). Even official novel showed an prototype of surface air artillery by a scene that Fleet-girl lead by Kagerou attempt to shoot down the hostile aircraft, which could replace with missile nowadays, meaning the author might also admit the game also lack with some defendsive weapon.<p>
The third one was the battle scene of the arcade game. Same as the webgame, it also didn`t invest any computer resources in projecting surruonding environment. Every time a fleet of Fleet-girls come across an area, the game just let you see there is some random island nearby, while those land are just some pile of earth and nothing else. Didn`t the developer know there is civilian building even on remote land? I suppose they are smart enough so they should know about this. Besides what if the battle zone was a offshore oilrig district?<br>
As a result that they have no intention of making realistic game background, that hampered the player interest in the game.(but of course, perhaps those players just want to focus on their fleet)<br>
Now we move on to serious part, something about this game has been pissing off plenty of Chinese speaking players. Many of them focus on complaining the how complex and annoying the game mechanism. Like fleet labeling-system keeps bringing them trouble because fleet-girls that apply to it would not be able to change position until the game special event ended. Second thing that considered unacceptable by some unlucky players was some enemies keep targeting some fleet-girls who is important to beat the event boss, making them unactive after suffering from hurt and the entire fleet will lose a significant source of fire power .
<BR>
So with more controllable combat personels, the game shall be much more entertaining and satisfying.
